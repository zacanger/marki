[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/markvi.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/markvi/)

simple markdown editor in angular with realtime preview
based on codemirror  
using the always-fantastic marked parser by @chjj  

plans:
* rewrite parser (markdown-extra-ish, future)
* actually implement the vi-like keybinds (see scripts/vi.js)
* eventual rewrite to hide from all that angular
* integrate with my rough attempt at a blog platform
* desktop client (electron-test branch)
* general shrinkage
* actually doing that 'beautiful' bit
