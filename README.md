## DEPRECATION NOTICE
**markvi** was a fun little experiment, and it served its purpose. But the product I wanted to build, it turns out, already exists. There are a lot of in-browser Markdown editors, of course, but there's also a really good desktop Markdown editor with almost the same layout, great themes, and togglable vim keybinds.

I highly suggesting checking out [Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/) if you need a dedicated desktop Markdown editor. It does everything I meant to do with **markvi** (and 'ayuba' as well), and it's faster and smoother than my app was.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/markvi.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/markvi/)

simple markdown editor in angular with realtime preview
based on codemirror  
using the always-fantastic marked parser by @chjj  
oh, and it's got vi keybinds.

plans:
* rewritten parser
* desktop client (likely nw.js)
* minimongo or similar storage (internal)
* reorg, losing the bower, gulping all the things
* easy theme switching
