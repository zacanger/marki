[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/markvi.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/markvi/)

simple markdown editor in angular with realtime preview
based on codemirror  
using the always-fantastic marked parser by @chjj  
oh, and it's got vi keybinds.

plans:
* rewritten parser
* desktop client (likely nw.js)
* minimongo or similar storage (internal)
* reorg, losing the bower, gulping all the things
* easy theme switching
